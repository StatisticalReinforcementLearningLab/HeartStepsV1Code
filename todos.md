### Cleaning

1. Refine availability indicator definition with phone usage data. NB: The usage data times are local, but do not contain time zone information.
2. Apply fixes to planning randomization status as discussed in data meeting.
3. Verify that the analysis data set contains enough information to evaluate all contextual variables.
  * Bring in use of phone (at notification, for non-essential tasks).
  * Check weather, location.
  * Check category levels (no response).
  * Bring suggestion interaction, timeout.
4. Update summary to reflect above activities and degree of missingness in preparation for Nick's imputation work.

### Documentation

1. Finish tabulating source data files and variables.
2. Tabulate analysis data files and variables. Make notes on data issues.
3. Check that Nick understands code comments.
